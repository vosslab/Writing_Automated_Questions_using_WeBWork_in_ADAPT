# Changelog

## 2026-01-12
- Expanded `README.md` with repository layout, topic coverage, and usage guidance
  based on the Insight-HTML exports.
- Replaced `README.md` with the chapter expansion plan for the `Textbook/` guide.
- Removed autogenerated `Textbook/00_Front_Matter/` and `Textbook/99_Back_Matter/` folders to
  avoid confusion about where editable content belongs.
- Filled previously-empty chapter HTML files and expanded existing chapter pages with PGML-first,
  science-focused guidance using the local Insight/WebWorK HTML archives as source material.
- Added `tools/html_lint_checker.py` (lxml-based) and `tests/run_html_lint.sh` to lint textbook HTML
  for LibreTexts compatibility (no links, no JavaScript).
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with the repo intent (textbook/guide) and the HTML authoring constraints.
- Updated `README.md` plan to reflect the no-link rule and removal of front/back matter.
- Added a new Chapter 1 comparison page and a brief comparison section in Chapter 1.2 to position
  WeBWorK against other autograded formats (H5P, LMS packages, quiz banks, etc.).
- Updated the Chapter 1.4 comparison table to use LibreTexts responsive table markup while keeping
  explicit column widths.
- Added `docs/LIBRETEXTS_HTML_GUIDE.md` documenting the standard LibreTexts-compatible table format
  and other HTML authoring rules for `Textbook/`.
- Documented the requirement that every `X.0-Index.html` chapter index ends with
  `<p>{{template.ShowOrg()}}</p>` and updated all chapter index files to include it.
- Removed explicit subsection filename lists from `Textbook/06_WeBWorK_for_Different_Subjects/6.0-Index.html`
  to avoid link-like navigation in LibreTexts and rely on `{{template.ShowOrg()}}` instead.
- Added Chapter 5 question type subsections with science examples for MC, MA, MATCH, NUM, FIB,
  MULTI_FIB, and ORDER.
- Refocused Chapter 6 back to subject-specific guidance that assumes the Chapter 5 question types.
- Added `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md` with page summaries for each `Textbook/` HTML page.
- Updated `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md` to use three human-readable sentences per page and
  to avoid the words "learning", "objective", "outcome", and "goal".
- Added a short "SEO tags" list to the third sentence of each page summary in
  `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md`.
- Rewrote `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md` to vary sentence openers while keeping the
  three-sentence structure and the stable "Use it ..." third sentence.
- Reorganized the textbook chapter layout by adding a Chapter 1 quickstart, splitting question
  types into `Textbook/05_Question_Types/`, and moving the ADAPT workflow into `Textbook/07_ADAPT_Workflow/`.
- Expanded the PGML chapter with new subsection pages under `Textbook/03_PGML_PG_Markup_Language/`.
- Added placeholder chapters for debugging/QA, randomization, answer checking, accessibility,
  maintenance/sharing, and appendices under `Textbook/08_*` through `Textbook/12_*` and
  `Textbook/90_Appendices/`.
