PGML (PG Markup Language) is the recommended way to write the student-facing text of a WeBWorK
problem. It is designed to replace older authoring patterns that required long blocks of text and
manual escaping.
</p>

<p>
This chapter is the core of the book: most science-friendly question writing can be done by
combining a small PG setup with a clear PGML prompt.
</p>

<h2>What PGML gives you</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Readable prompts that look similar to the rendered output.</li>
	<li>Math in TeX or calculator notation, with consistent delimiters.</li>
	<li>Answer blanks that can be tied directly to answers.</li>
	<li>Simple structure tools (headings, lists, tables) that fit science prompts.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The subsections in this chapter cover the small set of PGML features you will use constantly:
math notation, answer blanks, lists for workflows, tables for data, and a small "escape hatch" for
advanced insertion when PGML alone is not enough.
</p>
<p>
If you are unsure which PGML pattern to use, start with the simplest option that clearly
communicates the task. Most grading issues in life science questions come from misaligned
structure rather than missing features. When in doubt, clarity beats cleverness.
