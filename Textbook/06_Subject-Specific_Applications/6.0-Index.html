The same PGML techniques work across disciplines, but the best question banks feel like the
subject: the prompt style, the data format, and the answer expectations match what students do in
that field. This chapter collects "patterns" for science and descriptive courses, inspired by the
types of prompts used in science-focused question banks.
</p>

	<p>
	This chapter assumes you already know the core question types from <a href="/@go/page/488662">Chapter 5</a>.
	The focus here is how to apply those question types to a specific subject area with realistic
	prompts, units, and data.

<p>
Life-science-first emphasis: many of the subsections below are designed to answer "what breaks when
the content is biology?" and to highlight patterns that remain robust for grading.
</p>

<h2>General pattern: stable story, variable numbers</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Keep the scenario fixed (one paragraph).</li>
	<li>Randomize 2-4 values that drive the calculation.</li>
	<li>Ask for one target quantity per blank.</li>
	<li>Include a short units line so students know what to report.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Genetics</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Counts and proportions: genotype counts in a table, ask for a probability or expected count.</li>
	<li>Two-step prompts: compute a ratio, then interpret what it implies.</li>
	<li>Multiple choice statements: one conceptual check after a numeric calculation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Biochemistry</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Enzyme kinetics: compute a velocity given parameters, with tolerance and unit handling.</li>
	<li>pH and pKa: structured prompts with a small table of groups and pKa values.</li>
	<li>Gel migration: rank-order or compute distance given a log-scale relationship.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Molecular biology</h2>
<ul>
	<li>PCR setup: compute final concentrations from stock solutions.</li>
	<li>Cloning logic: multiple choice about which construct is valid given constraints.</li>
	<li>Expression analysis: interpret a small table of fold changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Biostatistics</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Chi-squared: compute a test statistic from a contingency table.</li>
	<li>Confidence intervals: compute a bound and select an interpretation statement.</li>
	<li>Probability distributions: keep the parameters simple and the interpretation clear.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Prefer tables and clearly labeled values over long prose.</li>
	<li>Use PGML substitutions so variables render correctly inside math.</li>
	<li>Use consistent rounding rules and make them explicit when needed.</li>
	<li>Keep randomness biologically plausible (do not generate impossible scenarios).</li>
</ul>
