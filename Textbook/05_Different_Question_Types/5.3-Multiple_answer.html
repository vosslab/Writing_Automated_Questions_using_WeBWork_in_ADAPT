Multiple Answer (MA) is best when more than one choice is correct and the learning objective
includes recognizing a set of correct statements.

Multiple answer works best when you can define membership in the set using a rule students can
apply. State "Select all that apply" explicitly, keep the set small, and avoid choices that depend
on exceptions you did not teach. This type is excellent for wet lab requirements and "which
statements are supported" checks, but it punishes ambiguity.
