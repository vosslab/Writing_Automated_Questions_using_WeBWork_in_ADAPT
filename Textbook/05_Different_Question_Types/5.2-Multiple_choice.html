Multiple Choice (MC) is best for a single conceptual decision where one answer is clearly correct
and the distractors represent plausible misconceptions.
</p>
<p>
A good biology multiple choice item is really a single claim test. Write the stem so the correct
choice is correct for one reason, and each distractor is wrong for one specific reason you would
actually see on an exam. If two choices are defensible under different assumptions, the problem
is the stem, not the students.
</p>
<p>
The most common break is mixed formats inside the choice list, like fractions mixed with decimals
or words mixed with symbols. Keep choices parallel and decide your conventions first, then write
distractors to match that convention.

<h2>Inputs</h2>
<ul>
	<li><code>question_text</code> (str): the question prompt</li>
	<li><code>choices_list</code> (list): answer choices</li>
	<li><code>answer_text</code> (str): the correct answer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Science example (genetics)</h2>
<p>
Use this type for a single decision, like recognizing a pattern in an inheritance scenario.
</p>

<pre>
question_text:
  In a diploid organism, allele A is dominant to allele a.
  Two heterozygous parents (Aa x Aa) produce offspring.
  What fraction of offspring are expected to be homozygous recessive (aa)?

choices_list:
  - 1/4
  - 1/2
  - 3/4
  - 1

answer_text: 1/4
</pre>

<h2>Authoring notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Keep choices parallel in format (all fractions, all numbers, etc.).</li>
	<li>Use distractors that match common mistakes (for example confusing genotype vs phenotype).</li>
</ul>
