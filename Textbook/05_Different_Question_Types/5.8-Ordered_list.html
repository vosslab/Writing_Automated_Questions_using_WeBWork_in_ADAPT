<p>
Ordered List (ORDER) is best for sequencing steps in a process. In science courses it is useful
for protocols and workflows (PCR, gel electrophoresis, sample prep), as long as the sequence is
well-defined.
</p>
<p>
Ordered list questions work best for canonical cycles and short protocols, not for long
procedures. If your course has multiple acceptable orders depending on reagent choice or
instrument, this type will create disputes. Keep lists short and pick sequences students should be
able to justify, not merely recite.

<h2>Inputs</h2>
<ul>
	<li><code>question_text</code> (str)</li>
	<li><code>ordered_answers_list</code> (list): correct sequence</li>
</ul>

<h2>Science example (PCR workflow)</h2>
<pre>
question_text:
  Put the following PCR steps in the correct order.

ordered_answers_list:
  - Denaturation
  - Primer annealing
  - Extension
</pre>

<h2>Authoring notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Only use ORDER when there is a single standard sequence for the context you are testing.</li>
	<li>Keep the list short (3-6 items) to avoid turning it into a memory game.</li>
</ul>
