<p style="background-color: #ffedd5; padding: 6px 10px;"><strong>Statement</strong></p>
<p>
The Statement is the student-facing prompt written in PGML. It is where the story, data, and
tasks become visible, and where each blank must be tied to one answer object from Setup.
</p>

<h2>How to read this code</h2>
<p>
The statement is the only part of the file that students actually read. Your goal here is to
keep the text readable while making sure every blank is unambiguous and attached to the correct
answer checker. PGML allows you to do this without mixing formatting logic into setup code.
</p>
<p>
The excerpt below shows the full statement used in the example, including how answer objects are
inserted into the text.
</p>
<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
My favorite color is

[_]{$radio1}

The same question with horizontal options:

My favorite color is [_]{$radio2}
END_PGML

<p>
If grading works but students are confused, the problem is usually here rather than in setup.
Read the statement out loud and check whether each blank clearly signals what kind of answer is
expected.
</p>

<p>
Think of the Statement as a contract. The text you show here must match what the checker
accepts, or students will feel the grading is arbitrary even when their reasoning is right.
Example: the prompt asks for one choice, but the blank is tied to a different answer object.
</p>
<p>
Choose the structure that reduces reading load: use short paragraphs for a single task, lists for
steps, and tables for multi-value data. If a prompt feels hard to scan, structure is usually the
fix, not more words.
</p>
<p>
Why this exists: it is the student-facing prompt that ties the story to the answer blanks.

Fast test: render one seed, enter the expected answer, confirm grading, then change the seed and
repeat.

Blank binding smell test: if a blank is visible but always marks wrong, confirm it is attached to
an answer object defined in Setup.
</p>

<p>
Use tables only when there is real data to scan or compare, not to simulate layout. Lists and
short paragraphs are usually better for narrative prompts.

For radio buttons and other choice-based inserts, load <code>parserRadioButtons.pl</code> and
follow the OpenWeBWorK technique samples for multiple choice patterns, using those pages as the
pattern directory.
</p>

<p>
MultiAnswer is an optional advanced variant for interdependent blanks; use the
<code>parserMultiAnswer.pl</code> documentation and its sample problem when you need shared logic.
