<p>
WeBWorK is useful when you want repeated, low-friction practice with immediate feedback and
consistent grading. In science courses, the strength is not "more math", but rather repeatable
workflows for units, significant figures, tabular data, and numeric reasoning inside realistic
prompts.
</p>

<h2>Reasons instructors use it</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Immediate feedback supports iterative learning.</li>
	<li>Algorithmic variants reduce copying and encourage practice.</li>
	<li>Answer checking is explicit and reproducible (tolerances, formats, partial credit patterns).</li>
	<li>Problems are text-based and versionable (easy to clone and modify).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why PGML matters</h2>
<p>
While a WeBWorK problem is "a PG file", this guide discourages writing long blocks of text in
regular PG. PGML is designed so that the prompt reads like the rendered output, and answer blanks
can be tied directly to answers in the same place you write the question.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Readable prompts with inline and display math.</li>
	<li>Answer blanks like <code>[_____]{...}</code> that stay close to the text they grade.</li>
	<li>Variable substitution that formats MathObjects correctly in TeX or calculator notation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Science-friendly patterns</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use a short narrative plus a table of measurements.</li>
	<li>Ask for a computed quantity with units and controlled rounding.</li>
	<li>Include one or two conceptual checks (multiple choice) when appropriate.</li>
	<li>Prefer small, composable randomizations over complicated logic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How WeBWorK compares (briefly)</h2>
<p>
Other systems can also deliver automated questions (for example H5P interactive content,
standardized LMS-import item packages, and LMS-native quiz questions). The main reason to choose
WeBWorK in a science course is
when you want robust answer parsing and checking (MathObjects), repeatable algorithmic variants,
and clear, readable prompt authoring via PGML.
