<p>
This chapter is about a faster way to preview and debug WeBWorK problems while you are writing
them. It is most useful when ADAPT preview fails with a generic error and you need a line number
and a real message.
</p>

<p>
This chapter introduces <code>webwork-pg-renderer</code> as a lightweight way to preview and test
problems locally. The goal is not to replace full testing in WeBWorK or ADAPT, but to give you a
tight edit-preview loop for day-to-day authoring.
</p>

<p>
The renderer uses the same PG 2.17 subset as ADAPT, so missing macros here are missing in ADAPT
as well. Use local rendering to catch subset issues before you import into ADAPT.
</p>

<h2>What this tool is (and is not)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>It is:</strong> a local renderer for PG and PGML that helps you iterate quickly with reproducible seeds.</li>
	<li><strong>It is not:</strong> a full WeBWorK deployment, course manager, or replacement for ADAPT assignment preview.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to use local rendering</h2>

<h2>Minimal prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Podman or Docker installed on your machine.</li>
	<li>A local folder that contains your <code>.pg</code> files.</li>
	<li>A quick health check: <code>GET /health</code> should return a 200 status.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The one rule that saves hours</h2>
<p>
When a problem fails, write down (1) the file path and (2) the seed. Do not change either one until
the failure is fixed.
</p>

<h2>Apply it today</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use local rendering first for line-level errors and rapid iteration.</li>
	<li>Use ADAPT preview last to confirm assignment context and student view.</li>
</ul>
