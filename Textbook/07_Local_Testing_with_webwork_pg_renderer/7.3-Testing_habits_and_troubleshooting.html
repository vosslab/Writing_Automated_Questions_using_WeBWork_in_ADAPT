<p>
Most failures in WeBWorK problem authoring are predictable: a blank is not tied to the intended
answer, a random value produces an impossible case, or the student-facing render hides an
assumption you thought was obvious. This section collects a small QA pass that catches most issues
quickly.
</p>

<h2>Start here when rendering fails</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Re-render with the same file path and seed.</li>
	<li>If it fails, copy the error message and the line number into your notes.</li>
	<li>If it renders, switch seeds and look for a variant that breaks the biology or the grading.</li>
</ol>

			<td data-th="Symptom">Prompt looks right, but grading is "wrong"</td>
			<td data-th="Likely cause">Tolerance mismatch, units mismatch, or accepted variants not defined</td>
			<td data-th="First fix to try">Restate expected units next to the blank and compare the checker settings to the solution wording.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td data-th="Symptom">Only some seeds "make sense"</td>
			<td data-th="Likely cause">Randomization range allows impossible biology</td>
			<td data-th="First fix to try">Add constraints so generated values stay plausible (no negative concentrations, no impossible probabilities).</td>

<h2>Variant sweeps (catch broken randomization)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Render multiple variants and scan for impossible or meaningless cases.</li>
	<li>Watch for awkward rounding, repeating decimals, or values that make the story unclear.</li>
	<li>Constrain random values so the biology stays plausible (concentrations, probabilities, rates).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Boundary values (catch grading edge cases)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Test values near expected boundaries (zero, one, and simple fractions).</li>
	<li>Check that tolerances and rounding expectations match what the prompt asks for.</li>
	<li>For text answers, decide what variants you accept (plural/singular, hyphens, and case).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Student-view behavior (catch workflow surprises)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Confirm the prompt reads cleanly and does not rely on hidden formatting.</li>
	<li>Confirm each blank appears where you expect and has clear unit and format cues.</li>
	<li>Use logs and any available health check to separate PG syntax problems from environment or rendering issues.</li>
	<li>Check that renders return 200 status with valid HTML or JSON output.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apply it today</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Adopt a repeatable QA pass: preview, sweep variants, test one boundary case, then publish.</li>
	<li>When something breaks, keep the failing seed and file path so you can reproduce the same case.</li>
</ul>
