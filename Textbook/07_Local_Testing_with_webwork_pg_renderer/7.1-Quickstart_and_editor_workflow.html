Local rendering works best when it feels like editing a document: open a problem file, render it,
make a small change, and render again. This section outlines a simple workflow you can repeat
every day.
</p>
<p>
Think of this like a lab workflow. You keep one sample (a single <code>.pg</code> file), one condition
(a fixed seed), and you change one variable at a time. The payoff is that you can reproduce the
same failure and fix it without guessing.
</p>

<h2>First run checklist (5 minutes)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Check the renderer status with <code>GET /health</code>.</li>
	<li>Open the editor page and load <code>private/yourfile.pg</code>.</li>
	<li>Set a seed (start with something memorable like <code>1234</code>).</li>
	<li>Render once before editing so you know what "working" looks like.</li>
	<li>Make one small text edit, save, then render again.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choose one file and make it reproducible</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Pick one <code>.pg</code> file to work on and keep the path stable while you iterate.</li>
	<li>Use a fixed seed when you are debugging so the same random variant renders each time.</li>
	<li>Change one thing per iteration so you can tell what caused the difference.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Private folder workflow</h2>
<p>
Place your files inside the <code>private/</code> folder that is mounted into the renderer. The web
editor at <code>http://localhost:3000</code> can then load the file path directly.
</p>

<h2>What to record while you work</h2>
<table class="mt-responsive-table">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Record</th>
			<th>Example</th>
			<th>Why it matters</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td data-th="Record">File path</td>
			<td data-th="Example"><code>private/enzyme_kinetics.pg</code></td>
			<td data-th="Why it matters">Keeps your failing case tied to one file.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td data-th="Record">Seed</td>
			<td data-th="Example"><code>1234</code></td>
			<td data-th="Why it matters">Locks the random variant so you can reproduce the same render.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td data-th="Record">What you changed</td>
			<td data-th="Example">"Changed units from mM to &mu;M in the prompt"</td>
			<td data-th="Why it matters">Makes debugging traceable when grading stops matching the story.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Render and check the student-facing prompt</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Render the problem and read it like a student would read it.</li>
	<li>Confirm the story makes sense with the chosen randomized values (units, ranges, and rounding).</li>
	<li>Confirm every answer blank is visible, in the right order, and has the right unit/format cues nearby.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What "done" looks like for one edit</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The prompt reads cleanly as a student-facing question.</li>
	<li>The values are plausible for biology (units, ranges, rounding).</li>
	<li>Every blank appears where expected and matches the intended answer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Save edits back to disk</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Keep edits small and frequent rather than making one large rewrite.</li>
	<li>When you find a failing case, keep the file path and seed so you can reproduce it later.</li>
	<li>Once the local render looks right, move to course-level testing for the final check.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apply it today</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use local rendering for the tight edit-preview loop, then use ADAPT for the final publish workflow.</li>
	<li>When debugging, write down the failing seed and do not change it until the failure is fixed.</li>
</ul>
