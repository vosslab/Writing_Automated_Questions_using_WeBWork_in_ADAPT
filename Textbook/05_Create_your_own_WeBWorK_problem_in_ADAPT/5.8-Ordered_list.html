<p>
Ordered List (ORDER) is best for sequencing steps in a process. In science courses it is useful
for protocols and workflows (PCR, gel electrophoresis, sample prep), as long as the sequence is
well-defined.

<h2>Inputs</h2>
<ul>
	<li><code>question_text</code> (str)</li>
	<li><code>ordered_answers_list</code> (list): correct sequence</li>
</ul>

<h2>Science example (PCR workflow)</h2>
<pre>
question_text:
  Put the following PCR steps in the correct order.

ordered_answers_list:
  - Denaturation
  - Primer annealing
  - Extension
</pre>

<h2>Authoring notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Only use ORDER when there is a single standard sequence for the context you are testing.</li>
	<li>Keep the list short (3-6 items) to avoid turning it into a memory game.</li>
</ul>
