<p>
This section introduces core question types used across many assessment systems. These are often
useful for concept checks, terminology, and simple workflows that do not require WeBWorK-style
answer parsing or algorithmic randomization.
</p>

<p>
In this textbook, question types are treated as a practical authoring skill: you learn the patterns
in Chapter 5, and then Chapter 6 shows how to apply those patterns in specific scientific subjects.
</p>

<h2>How this fits a PGML-first course</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Use WeBWorK (PGML-first) for numeric and formula-based practice where robust parsing and
		answer checking matters.
	</li>
	<li>
		Use these question types for portable, simple interaction patterns (multiple choice, matching,
		ordering, fill-in-the-blank).
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported question types</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Multiple Choice (MC)</li>
	<li>Multiple Answer (MA)</li>
	<li>Matching (MATCH)</li>
	<li>Numerical Entry (NUM)</li>
	<li>Fill-in-the-Blank (FIB)</li>
	<li>Multi-Part Fill-in-the-Blank (MULTI_FIB)</li>
	<li>Ordered List (ORDER)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Science prompt style (recommended)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Keep the story stable and short.</li>
	<li>Use explicit numbers and units in the prompt when relevant.</li>
	<li>Prefer tables for data instead of long prose when the problem is data-driven.</li>
	<li>For concept checks, write distractors that reflect common misconceptions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Input conventions</h2>
<p>
Each type is defined by a small set of inputs. The next sections show a science example for each
type using those inputs.
