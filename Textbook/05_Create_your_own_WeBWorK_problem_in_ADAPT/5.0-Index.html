<p>
This chapter focuses on the ADAPT workflow: creating, finding, cloning, and assigning WeBWorK
questions. The source archive includes several short video-based guides; this chapter turns that
into a written checklist you can follow while building a question bank.
</p>

<h2>Workflow overview</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Create or clone a question into your personal question area.</li>
	<li>Edit the code and metadata.</li>
	<li>Test and revise until the prompt, answers, and scoring behave correctly.</li>
	<li>Add the question to an assignment.</li>
	<li>Reorder questions, adjust points, and publish.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Practical checklist for a new WeBWorK question</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Start from a working PGML-first template (do not start from a blank file).</li>
	<li>Keep PG setup minimal: values, context, answer objects.</li>
	<li>Write the prompt in PGML and attach answers to blanks.</li>
	<li>Use a realistic science story and keep the story stable across randomizations.</li>
	<li>Verify units, rounding expectations, and tolerance settings.</li>
	<li>Preview multiple student versions to ensure randomization stays valid.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Finding and reusing questions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use search to find existing questions close to what you want.</li>
	<li>Favorite or clone questions you plan to reuse.</li>
	<li>Clone before editing so you keep the original available as a reference.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding questions to assignments</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Add questions from multiple sources (search, commons, your courses, your question area).</li>
	<li>Reorder questions to match your intended learning progression.</li>
	<li>Adjust points only after you have confirmed the question behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quality assurance (before students see it)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Check that every answer blank has a corresponding answer checker.</li>
	<li>Check that random values never generate invalid biology or chemistry scenarios.</li>
	<li>Check that the prompt renders cleanly without relying on external links.</li>
	<li>Check accessibility: tables should be data tables, not layout hacks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Non-WeBWorK question types</h2>
<p>
ADAPT courses often mix WeBWorK questions with other question formats. This chapter includes a
question type cookbook with science examples (multiple choice, matching, ordering, and
fill-in-the-blank) that can complement a PGML-first WeBWorK workflow.
