<p>
This chapter provides a complete, copy-and-edit example of a PGML-first WeBWorK problem written in
a science-friendly style. The goal is to show the smallest amount of PG setup needed to support a
clear PGML prompt.
</p>

<h2>Example: simple dilution calculation</h2>
<p>
In a wet-lab workflow, students often dilute a stock solution. This problem asks for the final
concentration after dilution. The story stays fixed and only the numeric values change.

$c_stock = random(50, 200, 10);   # mg/mL
$v_stock = random(1, 5, 1);       # mL
$v_final = $v_stock + random(5, 25, 1);  # mL

$c_final = Real($c_stock * $v_stock / $v_final);
$c_final->cmp(tolType => "absolute", tol => 0.1);

BEGIN_PGML
You have a stock solution with concentration [`c_{stock} = [$c_stock]`]
mg/mL. You pipette [`V_{stock} = [$v_stock]`] mL into a new tube and bring the total volume to
[`V_{final} = [$v_final]`] mL.

What is the final concentration [`c_{final}`] in mg/mL?

[`c_{final} = `] [________]{$c_final}

<h2>Why this example is PGML-first</h2>
<ul>
	<li>PG setup defines only the randomized values and the answer checker.</li>
	<li>PGML contains the full prompt, with variables substituted into the text.</li>
	<li>The answer blank includes the answer object right next to the question.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to adapt this example</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Change the story and keep the math.</li>
	<li>Keep units explicit in the prompt.</li>
	<li>Add a second part only when it helps learning, not because it is possible.</li>
	<li>If you need a table of measurements, use the table helpers rather than ad-hoc HTML.</li>
</ul>
